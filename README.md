# Automatic-Credit-Card-Approval-Predictor
**Project Description**

Commercial banks receive numerous credit card applications daily. A significant number of these applications are rejected due to various reasons such as high loan balances, low income levels, or excessive inquiries on an individual's credit report. Manually analyzing these applications is not only mundane and error-prone but also time-consuming, and in the banking world, time is money.

To streamline this process, banks leverage machine learning techniques to automate the evaluation of credit card applications. This project aims to build an automatic credit card approval predictor using machine learning, emulating the methods employed by real-world commercial banks.

**Key Features:**

- **Data Preprocessing:** Handling missing values and applying one-hot encoding to categorical variables.
- **Feature Scaling:** Using StandardScaler to standardize numerical features.
- **Model Training:** Implementing and training multiple models including Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and XGBoost.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Performing grid search cross-validation to find the best parameters for each model.
- **Model Evaluation:** Comparing models based on accuracy and confusion matrix to identify the best-performing model.

**Technology Stack:**

- **Python:** Primary programming language.
- **Pandas & NumPy:** For data manipulation and preprocessing.
- **scikit-learn:** For implementing and training machine learning models.
